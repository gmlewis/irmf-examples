## cylinder-1.irmf

It is time to make some Platonic solids for building blocks.

```glsl
/*{
  irmf: "1.0",
  materials: ["PLA"],
  max: [5,5,5],
  min: [-5,-5,-5],
  units: "mm",
}*/

float cylinder(float radius, float height, in vec3 xyz) {
  // First, trivial reject on the two ends of the cylinder.
  if (xyz.z < 0.0 || xyz.z > height) { return 0.0; }
  
  // Then, constrain radius of the cylinder:
  float rxy = length(xyz.xy);
  if (rxy > radius) { return 0.0; }
  
  return 1.0;
}

void mainModel4(out vec4 materials, in vec3 xyz) {
  xyz.z += 2.5;
  materials[0] = cylinder(2.5, 5.0, xyz);
}
```

* Try loading [cylinder-1.irmf](https://gmlewis.github.io/irmf-editor/?s=github.com/gmlewis/irmf-examples/blob/master/examples/005-cylinder/cylinder-1.irmf) now in the experimental IRMF editor!

* Use [irmf-slicer](https://github.com/gmlewis/irmf-slicer) to generate an STL or voxel approximation.
