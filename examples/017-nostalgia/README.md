# 017-nostalgia

One of the very first programs I typed into an `Apple ][+` computer was
from an article in BYTE Magazine around 1979. It rendered the 3D function
below by drawing the image pixel by pixel, from back to front, and giving
an illusion of depth by erasing all pixels directly below each plotted pixel
as it went. The drawing took hours to complete, and I think it was written
in Apple Basic.

Here is that same function 40 years later, as an IRMF shader.

## cos125.irmf

![cos125.png](cos125.png)

```glsl
/*{
  irmf: "1.0",
  materials: ["PLA"],
  max: [5,5,5],
  min: [-5,-5,-5],
  units: "mm",
}*/

float cos125(in float thickness, in vec3 xyz) {
  float theta = length(xyz.xy);
  float z = cos(theta) + cos(2.0 * theta) + cos(5.0 * theta);
  return (xyz.z <= z && xyz.z >= z-thickness) ? 1.0 : 0.0;
}

void mainModel4(out vec4 materials, in vec3 xyz) {
  materials[0] = cos125(0.4, xyz);
}
```

* Try loading [cos125.irmf](https://gmlewis.github.io/irmf-editor/?s=github.com/gmlewis/irmf-examples/blob/master/examples/017-nostalgia/cos125.irmf) now in the experimental IRMF editor!

* Use [irmf-slicer](https://github.com/gmlewis/irmf-slicer) to generate an STL or voxel approximation.
