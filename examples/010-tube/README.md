## tube-1.irmf

Another surprisingly-simple model is a tube which is a cylinder with an inner
radius and an outer radius.

```glsl
/*{
  irmf: "1.0",
  materials: ["PLA"],
  max: [5,5,5],
  min: [-5,-5,-5],
  units: "mm",
}*/

float tube(float innerRadius, float outerRadius, float height, in vec3 xyz) {
  // First, trivial reject on the two ends of the tube.
  if (xyz.z < 0.0 || xyz.z > height) { return 0.0; }
  
  // Then, constrain the tube to the inner and outer radii.
  float rxy = length(xyz.xy);
  if (rxy < innerRadius || rxy > outerRadius) { return 0.0; }
  
  return 1.0;
}

void mainModel4(out vec4 materials, in vec3 xyz) {
  xyz.z += 5.0;
  materials[0] = tube(4.0, 5.0, 10.0, xyz);
}
```
