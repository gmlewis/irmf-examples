## tetrahedron-1.irmf

If we make a tetrahedron with a square base that fits with a (-1,-1,-1)-(1,1,1)
cube, then it could be scaled to any size independently along each axis.

```glsl
/*{
  irmf: "1.0",
  materials: ["PLA"],
  max: [1,1,0.5],
  min: [-1,-1,-0.5],
  units: "mm",
}*/

float squareTetrahedron(in vec3 xyz) {
  // Trivially reject above and below the tetrahedron.
  if (xyz.z < 0.0 || xyz.z > 1.0) { return 0.0; }
  
  // Calculate the new size based on the height.
  float zsize = mix(1.0, 0.0, xyz.z);
  
  if (any(greaterThan(xyz.xy, vec2(zsize)))|| any(lessThan(xyz.xy, vec2(-zsize)))) { return 0.0; }
  
  return 1.0;
}

void mainModel4(out vec4 materials, in vec3 xyz) {
  xyz.z += 0.5;
  materials[0] = squareTetrahedron(xyz);
}
```
