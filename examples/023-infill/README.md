# 023-infill

3D printing infill can also be easily accomplished with an IRMF shader.

## gyroid-1.irmf

This is a gyroid structure as defined on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroid):

![sin x cos y + sin y cos z + sin z cos x = 0](gyroid-equation.png)

![gyroid-1.png](gyroid-1.png)

```glsl
/*{
  irmf: "1.0",
  materials: ["PLA"],
  max: [5,5,5],
  min: [-5,-5,-5],
  units: "mm",
}*/

float gyroid(in float scale, in vec3 xyz) {
  xyz /= scale;
  float v = sin(xyz.x) * cos(xyz.y) + sin(xyz.y) * cos(xyz.z) + sin(xyz.z) * cos(xyz.x);
  return abs(v) < 0.2 ? 1.0 : 0.0;
}

void mainModel4(out vec4 materials, in vec3 xyz) {
  materials[0] = gyroid(0.5, xyz);
}
```

* Try loading [gyroid-1.irmf](https://gmlewis.github.io/irmf-editor/?s=github.com/gmlewis/irmf-examples/blob/master/examples/023-infill/gyroid-1.irmf) now in the experimental IRMF editor!

* Use [irmf-slicer](https://github.com/gmlewis/irmf-slicer) to generate an STL or voxel approximation.
